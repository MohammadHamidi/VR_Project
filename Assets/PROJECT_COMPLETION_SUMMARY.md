  - Telegraph → Fire laser sequence with LineRenderer visualization
  - 3D audio and particle effects

- **Power Meter System** (`PowerMeter.cs`)
  - Fills with perfect squats (+12) and valid squats (+6)
  - Passive decay (-2/s), hit penalty (-15)
  - Overcharge state at 100 power (8s duration)
  - Visual UI with color transitions and animations

- **Shockwave Mechanics** (`ShockwaveEmitter.cs`)
  - Triggers on squat during overcharge
  - Radial destruction (4-6m radius)
  - Destroys Scout drones instantly, stuns Heavy drones
  - Visual ring expansion with DOTween animations

- **Combat Scoring** (`CombatScoring.cs`)
  - Dodge: +50 points, Perfect squat: +25 bonus
  - Combo system with 10% multiplier per level
  - Lives system (3 lives, -1 on hit)
  - Session statistics tracking

- **Drone Spawner** (`DroneSpawner.cs`)
  - Wave-based spawning system
  - Configurable difficulty scaling
  - Dynamic drone composition (Scout/Heavy ratios)
  - Intelligent spawn positioning around player

- **Game Management** (`SquatGameManager.cs`)
  - Complete session flow: Calibration → Playing → Game Over
  - Timer system with visual warnings
  - Auto-restart and scene transitions
  - Comprehensive UI integration

## 🌉 **Bridge Balance Game (ENHANCED)**

### ✅ **Already Excellent Implementation**
Your bridge system was already **superior** to the spec:

- **Advanced Balance Tracking** (`BalanceChecker.cs`)
  - Real-time lateral offset detection (better than simple beam walk)
  - Bridge progress tracking with milestones
  - Movement speed and direction analysis
  - Comprehensive event system for all balance states

- **Physics Bridge Construction** (`SOLIDBridgeBuilder.cs`)
  - Dynamic bridge generation with realistic physics
  - Configurable plank count, spacing, and materials
  - Platform creation and player positioning

- **Enhanced Features Beyond Spec**:
  - Progress percentage tracking (0-100%)
  - Movement speed monitoring
  - Milestone system (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
  - Forward motion detection
  - Time estimation for completion

## 🎯 **Throwing Game (ENHANCED)**

### ✅ **Professional Implementation + New Triple-Ring Mode**

**Existing Features** (already excellent):
- Complete ball physics with XR grab interaction
- Target ring hit detection
- Level progression system with 6 pre-built levels
- Advanced level generator with environment creation
- Stage management and timing

**➕ NEW: Triple-Ring Tunnel Mode** (`TripleRingController.cs`):
- **Perfect Tunnel Detection**: Ball must pass through center of all 3 rings sequentially
- **Multiple Difficulties**: Easy/Medium/Hard with different ring sizes and tolerances
- **Center Tolerance System**: 7cm perfect tunnel zone
- **Sequential Hit Validation**: Enforces correct ring order
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Ring sizes scale from 40cm → 20cm (Easy → Hard)
- **Visual Feedback**: Active ring highlighting, success animations
- **Progressive Requirements**: 1-3 perfect tunnels needed per difficulty

---

## 🎮 **Complete Framework Features**

### ✅ **Core VR Systems**
- Full XR/VR setup with hand tracking
- Professional UI system (world-space Canvas)
- Scene management and transitions
- Data persistence and patient profiles
- Analytics and performance tracking

### ✅ **Code Quality**
- **Zero linting errors** - all code is clean and production-ready
